This is a 'petition signUp application' or we can use it for a multitude other uses. I have done this app numerous times using vanilla javascript but this time I made it using react. Using this app, we can ask participants of whatever event to fill in the necessary list of informations and the app will put the information accordingly in a table and save it in the next page, and we can route to the next page and see all the provided informations. The app tell us the current weather condition around the globe by only inserting the name of the city. Currently, since I am learning backend and databases, I am working on this app to integrate elements such as how to push given datas to the database and save them permantnently, and in case of necessity, how to delete files from the list etc.
